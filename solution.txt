1. Create a number_guessing_game folder in the project folder for your program
mkdir number_guessing_game
cd number_guessing_game
git init
git checkout -b main
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit" #1st commit

2. Create number_guess.sh in your number_guessing_game folder and give it executable permissions
touch number_guess.sh
chmod +x number_guess.sh
git add number_guess.sh
git commit -m "feat: add number guessing game" #2nd commit

3. Your git repository should have at least five commits
git add number_guess.sh
git commit -m "refactor: change variable name" #3rd commit

git add number_guess.sh
git commit -m "refactor: change query" #4th commit

git add README.md
git commit -m "refactor: insert details" #5th commit

4. Connect to PostgreSQL and create database
CREATE DATABASE number_guess;

\c number_guess

CREATE TABLE players(
	player_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE games(
	game_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	player_id int,
	number_of_guesses int,
	secret_number int,
	FOREIGN KEY(player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
);
